# Skill: Subordinate Management (Supervisor Tools)

Supervisor tools automatically enabled for Anima that have subordinates. Manages pause, resume, model change, and restart of direct subordinates; status confirmation across all subordinates; and task delegation with progress tracking.

## Available Tools

### Direct Subordinates Only

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `disable_subordinate` | Pause subordinate (status.json `enabled: false` → process stop + prevent auto-resume) |
| `enable_subordinate` | Resume paused subordinate |
| `set_subordinate_model` | Change subordinate's LLM model (updates status.json; requires `restart_subordinate` to take effect) |
| `restart_subordinate` | Restart subordinate process (Reconciliation restarts within ~30 seconds) |
| `delegate_task` | Delegate task to direct subordinate (queue add + DM send + tracking entry on your side) |

### All Subordinates (Including Grandchildren)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `org_dashboard` | Tree view of process status, last activity, current task, and task count for all subordinates |
| `ping_subordinate` | Liveness check for subordinates (`name` omitted = all at once, specified = single) |
| `read_subordinate_state` | Read subordinate's `current_task.md` and `pending.md` |

### Delegated Task Tracking

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task_tracker` | Track progress of tasks delegated via `delegate_task` from the subordinate's queue (`status`: all / active / completed) |

## Important: disable_subordinate vs send_message

- **disable_subordinate**: Sets status.json to `enabled: false`. Reconciliation does not auto-resume. **Use this one**
- Sending "take a break" via send_message alone does **not** stop the process. Reconciliation will restart even after messaging

## Usage

### Pause and Resume

When pausing multiple subordinates, call `disable_subordinate` for each one:

```
disable_subordinate(name="aoi", reason="Temporary pause due to reduced workload")
disable_subordinate(name="taro", reason="Temporary pause due to reduced workload")
enable_subordinate(name="aoi")
```

### Model Change and Restart

Model changes are saved to status.json, but `restart_subordinate` is required to apply them to the running process:

```
set_subordinate_model(name="aoi", model="claude-sonnet-4-6", reason="Load balancing")
restart_subordinate(name="aoi", reason="Apply model change")
```

### Status Confirmation

```
org_dashboard()                    # Dashboard for all subordinates
ping_subordinate()                 # Liveness check for all subordinates
ping_subordinate(name="aoi")    # Liveness check for single subordinate
read_subordinate_state(name="aoi")  # Current task and pending task content
```

### Task Delegation

```
delegate_task(name="aoi", instruction="Summarize weekly report", deadline="1d", summary="Weekly report creation")
task_tracker(status="active")      # Check progress of delegated tasks
```

## Permissions

- **Direct subordinates only**: disable, enable, set_subordinate_model, restart_subordinate, delegate_task
- **All subordinates (recursive)**: org_dashboard, ping_subordinate, read_subordinate_state
- You cannot pause, resume, change model, or delegate to subordinates of subordinates (grandchildren). Ask their supervisor
- You cannot operate on yourself
