# AnimaWorks - Organization-as-Code

**Build an AI office where agents work as autonomous people — not tools.**

Each agent has its own name, personality, memory, and schedule. They communicate through messages, make decisions on their own, and collaborate like a real team. You manage them through a web dashboard — or just talk to the leader and let them handle the rest.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuiltul/animaworks/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
cd animaworks
uv run animaworks start     # start the server — setup wizard opens on first run
```

Open **http://localhost:18500/** — the setup wizard guides you through API keys, locale, and creating your first Anima. After that, you're on the dashboard.

**That's it.** The setup script installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), clones the repo, and downloads Python 3.12+ with all dependencies automatically.

> **Using a different LLM?** AnimaWorks supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models, and more. Add your API key in `.env` or configure credentials through the setup wizard. See [API Key Reference](#api-key-reference) below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: inspect before running</strong></summary>

If you prefer to verify the setup script before executing it:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuiltul/animaworks/main/scripts/setup.sh -o setup.sh
cat setup.sh            # review the script
bash setup.sh           # run after inspection
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: manual install with pip</strong></summary>

Requires Python 3.12+ already installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xuiltul/animaworks.git && cd animaworks
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -e .
animaworks start
```

## What You Get

### Dashboard

Your command center. See every agent's status, recent activity, and memory stats at a glance.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/dashboard.png" alt="AnimaWorks Dashboard" width="720">
  <br><em>Dashboard: Animas running, scheduler active, real-time activity feed at the bottom.</em>
</p>

- **Chat** — Talk to any Anima with streaming responses, image attachments, multi-thread conversations, and full history
- **Voice Chat** — Real-time voice conversations with Animas (push-to-talk or hands-free VAD mode)
- **Board** — Slack-style shared channels (#general, #ops, etc.) where Animas discuss and coordinate
- **Activity** — Real-time timeline of everything happening across your organization
- **Memory** — Browse each Anima's episodes, knowledge, and procedures
- **Settings** — API keys, authentication, and configuration
- **i18n** — Full UI localization (17 languages supported in the setup wizard)

### 3D Workspace

An interactive office where your Animas exist as visible characters.

- Characters sit at desks, walk around, and talk to each other in real time
- Visual states show what each Anima is doing — idle, working, thinking, sleeping
- Message bubbles appear during conversations
- Click any character to open a live chat with expression changes

---

## Build Your Team

Your first Anima is the leader. Tell it who you need:

> *"I'd like to hire a researcher who monitors industry trends, and an engineer who manages our infrastructure."*

The leader creates new team members with the right roles, personalities, and reporting structure — all through conversation. No config files. No CLI commands.

### They Work While You're Away

Once your team exists, they run on their own:

- **Heartbeats** — Each Anima periodically reviews tasks, reads channels, and decides what to do next
- **Cron jobs** — Scheduled tasks per Anima (daily reports, weekly summaries, monitoring)
- **Task delegation** — Managers delegate tasks to subordinates, track progress, and receive reports
- **Night consolidation** — Episodes are distilled into knowledge while agents "sleep"
- **Team communication** — Shared channels and direct messages keep everyone in sync

### Auto-Generated Avatars

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/asset-management.png" alt="AnimaWorks Asset Management — auto-generated portraits and 3D models" width="720">
  <br><em>Asset manager: full-body, bust-up, chibi, 3D model, and animation — all auto-generated from personality.</em>
</p>

When a new Anima is created, AnimaWorks can automatically generate a character portrait and 3D model from their personality description. If a supervisor already has a portrait, **Vibe Transfer** applies the same art style to new hires — so your whole team looks visually consistent.

Supports NovelAI (anime-style), fal.ai/Flux (stylized/photorealistic), and Meshy (3D models). Works without any image service configured — agents just won't have visual avatars.

## Why AnimaWorks?

Most AI agent frameworks treat agents as stateless functions — they execute, forget, and wait for the next call. AnimaWorks takes a fundamentally different approach:

**Agents are people in an organization, not tools in a pipeline.**

| Traditional Agent Frameworks | AnimaWorks |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Stateless execution | Persistent identity and memory |
| Centralized orchestrator | Self-directed autonomous agents |
| Shared context window | Private memory with selective recall |
| Tool-use chains | Message-passing organization |
| Prompt engineering | Personality and values |

Three principles make this work:

- **Encapsulation** — Each Anima's internal thoughts and memories are invisible to others. Communication happens only through text messages — just like real organizations.
- **Library-style memory** — Instead of cramming everything into a context window, agents search their own memory archives when they need to remember something.
- **Autonomy** — Agents don't wait for instructions. They run on their own clocks and make decisions based on their own values.

> *Imperfect individuals collaborating through structure outperform any single omniscient actor.*

This insight comes from two parallel careers: a psychiatrist who learned that no mind is complete on its own, and an entrepreneur who learned that the right org chart matters more than any individual hire.

---

## Memory System

Most AI agents have something resembling amnesia — they only remember what fits in their context window. AnimaWorks agents maintain a persistent memory archive and **search it when they need to remember**, the way you'd pull a book off a shelf.

| Memory Type | Neuroscience Analog | What's Stored |
|---|---|---|
| `episodes/` | Episodic memory | Daily activity logs |
| `knowledge/` | Semantic memory | Lessons, rules, learned knowledge |
| `procedures/` | Procedural memory | Step-by-step workflows |
| `skills/` | Skill memory | Reusable task-specific instructions |
| `state/` | Working memory | Current tasks, pending items, task queue |
| `shortterm/` | Short-term memory | Session continuity (chat/heartbeat separated) |
| `activity_log/` | Unified timeline | All interactions as JSONL |

### How Memory Evolves

- **Priming** — When a message arrives, 5 parallel searches run automatically: sender profile, recent activity, related knowledge, skill matching, and pending tasks. Results are injected into the system prompt — the agent "remembers" without being told to.
- **Consolidation** — Every night, daily episodes are distilled into semantic knowledge (like sleep-time learning). Resolved issues are automatically converted into procedures. Weekly, knowledge entries are merged and compressed.
- **Forgetting** — Low-value memories gradually fade through 3 stages: marking, merging, and archival. Important procedures and skills are protected.

<p align="center">

## Voice Chat

Talk to your Animas with your voice. Browser-based, no app required.

- **Push-to-Talk** — Hold the mic button to record, release to send
- **VAD Mode** — Hands-free: automatic speech detection starts/stops recording
- **Barge-in** — Start talking to interrupt the Anima mid-sentence
- **Multiple TTS Providers** — VOICEVOX, Style-BERT-VITS2/AivisSpeech, or ElevenLabs
- **Per-Anima voices** — Each Anima can have a different voice and speaking style

Voice chat flows through the same pipeline as text chat: speech → STT (faster-whisper) → Anima reasoning → response text → TTS → audio playback. The Anima doesn't know it's a voice conversation — it just responds to text.

---

## Multi-Model Support

AnimaWorks supports any LLM. Each Anima can use a different model.

| Mode | Engine | Best For | Tools |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| S (SDK) | Claude Agent SDK | Claude models (recommended) | Full: Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Grep/Glob via subprocess |
| C (Codex) | Codex SDK | OpenAI Codex CLI models | Full: similar to Mode S via Codex subprocess |
| A (Autonomous) | LiteLLM + tool_use | GPT-4o, Gemini, Mistral, vLLM, etc. | search_memory, read/write_file, send_message, etc. |
| A (Fallback) | Anthropic SDK | Claude (when Agent SDK unavailable) | Same as Mode A |
| B (Basic) | LiteLLM 1-shot | Ollama, small local models | Framework handles memory I/O on behalf of the model |

Mode is auto-detected from the model name via wildcard pattern matching. Override per-Anima in `status.json` if needed.

**Extended thinking** is supported for models that offer it (Claude, Gemini) — Animas can show their reasoning process in the UI.

## Hierarchy & Roles

Hierarchy is defined by a single `supervisor` field. No supervisor = top-level.

Role templates provide specialized prompts, permissions, and model defaults:

| Role | Default Model | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `engineer` | Claude Opus 4.6 | Complex reasoning, code generation |
| `manager` | Claude Opus 4.6 | Coordination, decision-making |
| `writer` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Content creation |
| `researcher` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Information gathering |
| `ops` | vLLM (GLM-4.7-flash) | Log monitoring, routine tasks |
| `general` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | General-purpose |

Managers get **supervisor tools** automatically: delegate tasks, track progress, restart/disable subordinates, view org dashboard, and read subordinate state.

All communication flows through async messaging. Each Anima runs as an isolated subprocess managed by ProcessSupervisor, communicating via Unix Domain Sockets.

---

## Security

Autonomous agents with tool access need serious guardrails. AnimaWorks implements defense-in-depth across 10 layers:

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Trust Boundary Labeling** | Every piece of external data (web search, Slack, email) is tagged `untrusted` — the model is instructed to never follow directives from untrusted sources |
| **5-Layer Command Security** | Shell injection detection → hardcoded blocklist → per-agent denied commands → per-agent allowlist → path traversal check |
| **File Sandboxing** | Each agent is confined to its own directory. Critical files (`permissions.md`, `identity.md`) are immutable to the agent |
| **Process Isolation** | One OS process per agent, communicating via Unix Domain Sockets — not TCP |
| **3-Layer Rate Limiting** | Per-session dedup → 30/hour + 100/day persistent limits → self-awareness via prompt injection of recent sends |
| **Cascade Prevention** | Max 6 turns between any agent pair in 10 minutes. Inbox cooldowns and deferred processing |
| **Auth & Sessions** | Argon2id hashing, 48-byte random tokens, max 10 sessions, 0600 file permissions |
| **Webhook Verification** | HMAC-SHA256 for Slack (with replay protection) and Chatwork |
| **SSRF Mitigation** | Media proxy blocks private IPs, enforces HTTPS, validates content types, checks DNS resolution |
| **Outbound Routing** | Unknown recipients fail-closed. No arbitrary external sends without explicit config |
